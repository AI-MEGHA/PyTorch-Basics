# PyTorch-Basics
PyTorch is a Python-based scientific computing package that uses the power of graphics processing units(GPU). It is also one of the preferred deep learning research platforms built to provide maximum flexibility and speed. It is known for providing two of the most high-level features; namely, tensor computations with strong GPU acceleration support and building deep neural networks on a tape-based autograd systems. There are many existing Python libraries which have the potential to change how deep learning and artificial intelligence are performed, and this is one such library. One of the key reasons behind PyTorchâ€™s success is it is completely Pythonic and one can build neural network models effortlessly. It is still a young player when compared to its other competitors, however, it is gaining momentum fast.
